PROJECT DAH.AM : A Gamentary of our homeland
- Download Unity 3d and Sketchup 3d
-- Unity 3d requires extra dependables and standard assets
-- For usage on mobile (android and iOS) the SDK of Java, Android and Xcode are needed
- Digitalize the miniDV tapes and the VHS cassets 
- Register the domain: daham.at or dah.am is am scheansten 

Game idea:
Develop an explorative game that allows a character to investigate the history of the oxengarten and how Stefanie made it her home.

The game should run on Android and iPhone as well as a VR build for the Google Daydream platform and Oculus DK2.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is similar to Monkey Island: The discovery of objects and clues like bits and pieces of the story. The story starts with the dead of Stefanie and retells the history of her life through fragments in a virtual, interactive environment. It deals in a playful manner with historical facts in a personal context and involes so the viewer as player in a history that is not package but process.

Questions regarding development:
Is game paused or does it freeze automatically?
Is the play tied to real timew in the sense that it reminds the player to discover anew. And if so, what changes from one freeze to the next?


Development time: 1 Month #daham

Goal: Develop the first episode of the game and port it to both android platform.

Story: The story starts with the habitation of the Oxengarten by Stefanie and ends with the building of the stable. The scene is simple and it is spring.
The terrain is magical and it plays in the years before Stefanie got married and moved here.

Milestones 1:

- Create a terrain from either the Unity Plugin or the colour gradient terrain app, the terrain should cover the whole of oxengarten 
- Create a day/night cycle within the map with a moon and a sun
- Create a session cycle within the map that change the entire terrain and weather (clear sky, fog, snow and rain)

Milestone 2: 

- Create textures and objects such as trees and grass fields, fences and an infinite run
- Create a background similar to the skybox to create the backdrop for the map or world and see how to incorporate a 360 degree photo
- Create characters such as a dog, chickens, swine and persons such as grandmum that walk around in the scene and maybe talk

Milestone 3:

- Create a movable character mechanics that allows the user to "walk through" the world as an ego perspective
- Create infinite terrain borders that give the illusion of an open world
- Create an on screen joystick that moves the character in the world
- Create discoverable elements that contain a media element such as an image, sound clip or video clip or text

Milestone 4:

- Create a logic that starts and ends the episode (a sort of intor and outro)
- Port the version to the android phone and test it
- Make a project website and make the game available on the Play market
================================
4th December is reelection: Make a mobile game: Squeez the bug and launch it on Android and iOS; make a tiny marketing page and run a display campaign

Daham project #daham
> Terrain generator for low polygons would cost 50 Euro
- Nested objects such as a camera and third person character is just like using layers in photoshop
- Scripts can be added by drag and drops and event triggers set actions such as appearing or dissapearing of objects
- Assets can be incorporated automatically and the build exported using the SDK of the devices
- Character movement is still dependend on the input device. The keys control does not work to full satisfaction or is wrong
- It is best to focus on one build > properly android and the implementation of a controller unit
- Building of a third person character running around is no option. Character should not be visible!
- Overall style is relevant - low polygon look and feel using comercial script and assets is good. 

Todo Models for Maastricht work


28. September
- Long Meeting about coming up projects
>> Weekly meeting | Documents to be send | List with plans: for me Blog and Digital Brochures 
- Meeting with Annabel: Worked as Dutch language docent, did training to become a carpenter, works since 8 years for the video
- Problem: Brigtcove eats up resources | we are stuck to a contract who's limit we currently exceed | we are on a pay as you go right now that will cost us 1000 Euro for one month if we don't change anything.
- Proposed solution: Moving to Youtube and Amazon AWS. Developing a module for in Drupal using the videojs.com js framework
- Annabel is married to the video project; reacts very emotional and dissmisal to advertisment and youtube as possible solution; The 5 stages of grief reflect well her dismay about the possible change. 

Arguments brought up against the sole use of youtube as video management system as opposed to the current setup of youtube and Brightcove (BC is mainly used as video archiving system; It use inside Drupal is header videos are selected from the media library; Jean Pierre does so):

- Youtube puts Advertisment on videos for which the UM does not have all rights
This happens f.e. if a student makes a video of his semester abroad and puts the soundtrack of Michel Jackson in the background. Youtube leaves the video online but puts advertisment in it that whos revenue are shared between the content right owner and youtube. This is a semi automated system that youtube puts in place and has agreed with all major music labels and other rights owner societies. Not judging the quality of the video per se it is not professional to use or distribute content for which the UM has not all rights.

This does not happen for videos that use copyright free audio or video footage which is the usual case when working with third parties such as T36 and others. No advertisment appears on such videos.

>>>NO PROB

- Video URL changes when f.e. a new version of the video is uploaded
This is true and there is no workaround. Every video that gets uploaded or reuploaded will receive a new URL. Practically the workaround is to double check each video befor uploading it that all information is correct. Meta information such as recording date, title, location, etc.... is editable after the video is uploaded and editable.

>>YES

- Playlists cannot be embedded on the Drupal website.
This is true for Brightcove and for Youtube alike. If a solution is needed then it needs to be implemented in either way.

>>NEUTRAL

- Look and Feel of the player cannot be adjusted
This refers to the overlay of either the youtube logo and the play button that has the iconic status of the famous video service. The current solution can serve as an example in point: I have screenshots of how the video looks on the page 1. Youtube and 2. Brightcove

>>NO PROBL

- Backend system that lists videos, creates playlists and offers analytics is not good
Youtube has also a backend with apps and allows for all and even more functionality then the Brightcove solution. 
>>NO PROBL



Maybe what Annabel needs is a solid backup solution and a management system for the videos that is both solid and accessible. Maybe Ger would be able to help out and provide the later part.

One major argument was that it does not look professional to use youtube. The point remains the same. The costs for this solution until 2021 is likely to exceed the 39.600 Euro which does not include fact that Bandwith, Storage is likely to double every two years.

- Update: #Daham project <Android_Test project file>
Worked on tutorial and made a built and live previewed it during production. The export went well; This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdEPRZUEwgY tutorial used.
- Installed Android SDK plus Studio and also JavaSDK
- Using Multipurpose Camera Rig as prefab and adusted settings so it does not rotate | works good
- The build is done using both SDK's and some settings that specify;
- In player settings > Other Settings > Identification> Bundler Identifier | Company and Product name needs to match exactly the one in the Player Settings
- In the project the only thing is a script that allows the mobile phones tilt to be utilized as controller. This is done by simply tagging the script as "Game Controller"
- The C# CrossPlatformInputInitialize is also needed and either an standard asset or importet
- You can create a folder in the Assets window and drag a scene in it. Scenes are actually saved or stored and build separately. 


31. September
- Update: #Daham project
- Decided to skip import of hightmap and instead using a terrain and a satelite shot as material. The sculpturing of the area is done by hand. This gives best results; Maybe not the fastest.
- Worked on separeat aspects and discovered two things: 1. Adding a Mash Collider makes mashes solid 2. An image can be imported as texture and turned into a material that is then used on a mash
- One script that shows a GUI that does the following: if the player comes close to a collider box (which is an empty 3d element where the mash rendere is deactivated and the box collider setting is on) that contains the script it shows a GUI interface f.e. a picture in the frontal view of the player. Works nice and is the first script that worked.

18. October 
- It is funny to note that when watching two many series of the kind of Carnival - lots of nonlinear film techniques - my senese of time gets mixed up. One time I was not sure what if it was wednesday or tuesday (this was last week) and also in my notes I used November instead of October so I mixed up the month.

As we ask permissions for every app. So why not also for this one. He also voiced the idea to use it for an open day; A simple app that allows everbody to listen to the presentation on an open day. They use https://mahara.org and https://www.kent.ac.uk/employabilitypoints/rewards-2016-17.html

On his quest the player meets people who just graduated, teach, or have lost their parents too and need his help. He need to solve simple puzzels and tasks that unlock little secrets that lead up to a

I contacted the provider of the script and announced the problem I have with the bouncing back of the "player" from solid objects. The reason is that the rigid body value creates a force response based on that value. By setting the value to 0.0001 the problem is solved.

- Got Camera and went to Zuiderlicht; Good idea was to personalize the application by making the app to be able to connect to SAP CRM. Learned a lot: Either Gameplay is great or graphic is awesome; Its called White paper marketing when I give stuff away for free in exchange for personal data.
- Write document for Aalt Willhem Heringa
- Investigate Axel Solution for Annabel
- Make the Mockup for the P1 Application
- Finish the VR Application


28. October
- Talk with Nicole about the Categories
- Talk with Michiel about bugs for the DI P4 project

7. November
- Contact and check with SV for camera and recording
- Making notes in the morning about project summary
- Nicole bought house and pm's mum died
- Worked on Payment form: Two options possible 1. using aanmelde.nl that is the same company as the payment processor; result medium; formating bad and user flow okay. 2. Manon pointed me to the fact that the Drupal form system also works. It does but with a trick. I need to redirect the user from the form manually after he/she filled out the fields (records are keept but no confirmation email is send) to the payment processor's page using the "button" function. This leads to user inconsistency and necessity to double check registered users. Users need to fill in all the info again to proceed to the form.
- Build the drupal form; easy; create new content "Detail page" and save draft.
- Start project: Google Indoor Maps + Beacon Integration: Budget plan etc.  


8. November
- Contact Sandra Daas / Spanija or so again to ask for BTW and payment costs

- Worked three hours in the morning and yestday evening on finishing up the DI P6 (Vr game); Meeting with Lissanee about the QR code tracker. It looks like the solution is not simple. Is it a good idea to let people develop the app and reuse the code for other purposes? How long would it take?
- Send the guy from Sjoprz the links 
- Make an appointment with Sueli > Done
- Go to SBE and copy some files 
- Meeting with Stijn from T36; Todo's: 1. Make a RFC list for Michil to implement in Drupal 2. Contact Filezilla or JW player to see if they offer a solution. He explained his situation and that he needed to recommend to his client not to use Brightcove anymore. They themselves have 180TB in house and use a system that does version managing of project files and source files themselves. In our case we only need to manage final master files and the corresponding meta information. He made 2 important points 1. For a websites pagerank or findability does not matter if its a yt or bc video that is embedded in the website. (three years ago it was different maybe). 2. Youtube beats BC in terms of interactivity (three years ago this was not the case). With BBW he has no feelings and would not recommend it. They are more a full service buro and do not focus on videos at all. Also to note: 2 of the three problems we initially started out with are by now solved.

- Morning I had a meeting with SBE's colleges esther and the bos. About the BDKT videos. Nothing new Michel mentioned that there is a UX inconvenience on the Department websites when switching between mobile view and general view. I will not work on the production on the videos. Afterwards we had a meeting with Alumni Pro the guys who keep 60.000 people in check and balance. Interesting side not is that segmentation yields to specialists as a thrill. More data only makes more data.
- Between 11 - 13 there where emails and more little things to do but not much concrete. A meeting with the team lasted more than two hours in which we learned that we get phones (maybe) and also 30 euro per person to celebrate christmas. The open day went very well. Too much students.

Title: Live Youtube Event: Run Up To Open Day

The idea is to have a day before the Open Day a 9 hours live show on youtube. Similar to the Saturday Night Live format a moderator hosts the show inviting students, lectureres and staff people and have an informal chat about topics relevant for students. In addition prospective students can "tune in" and have their questions answered.

Production: The production setup itself is completely independent of the Open Day organisation. It follows its own time scedule and is produced on behave of the Events team. Since it takes place a day before the Open Day there is also no direct interferance with the operation.

Target audience: Prospective and interested students from foreign countries who cannot attend an Open Day physically.

Goal: Is to give the target group the information they would otherwise get when they are on location in an entertaining and informing manner.

Platform: Youtube and Googel hangout

Setup: The setup consists of a host (Rendy Jansen) a production team (Science Vision) and production assistent (two students).

==== APRIL 2017 ===
10. April
I contacted Nicole and asked for a meeting. I wanted to show the mockup I created and discuss the two documents I send. My main question was about "How much hours can I expect the editorial team to work on this project?" because this helps me with making the planning and budget. I was really dissapointed because she could not give me an answer to the question. She agrees that form and content should make a meaningful whole but how exactly the content fits in was not clear to her. My reaction of dissapointment was later by Manon observed as anger. The point being that I accused Nicole of not reading my documents and Nicole was obviously oblivious about the content strategy.

What content strategy do you suggest for this project?

Do you have any successful examples?

Is there a house style document that explicates what form the content has to adhere to?

How should the content strategy (a content style - prose, journal, epic - its allegories or temperations, its tone of voice, pronouncements, etc.) effect the reader? 

Where do you find the resources necessary? Internal - External? Who?

How to solve this apparent dillema is unclear at this moment. Let's assume we want to come accross professional and work diligently. We need to go to an external party and ask how much X is? On that basis we can build up a budget. The project plan is likewise build in reverse causal order. We will say we need two weeks to test then we have the deployment date. We need to produce X amount of content by that moment so we need to calculate backwards from the moment we want it to be online to get an inidcation on where/when we start. 

But we do it the other way around. First I was asked for a budget proposal. I saw Juliennes presentation and handouts. It did not include the very first idea - only the budget (~30.000 Euro) was put to motion. Because we are so different from all other universities we started looking at their Virtual Open Day's and expect a copy or representative example for UM. This is an uncritical observation that I can substantiate with emails. 

But this does not stop there. Also on the content level one is forced to put into question everything we teach in the course "Managing Complex Projects". The initial, uncritical request recreates or reuse the exact same content types we already created for the Campus Tour, the website and for the LAW faculty (Programme informaiton, videos, interactive map). From the vantage point of us, nothing differentiates this marketing/recruitment tool structurally and content wise from what other universities do and we already did too. If I ask about performance indicators nobody knows much. The campus tours impact on student recruitment is more then questionable. The corporate website is in essence everything you need to know about programmes besides the human drama and its real life narrative which needs to be felt, not read. And then there are over thousand videos featuring alumni, students, projects, more projects, ... Not the absence of content triggers one interest but its superabundance. It's like poverty in the midst of wealthy or Mr. Krijnens fear  dissillusionment that few UM employees live in Limmel, Wittevorwenfeld or elsewhere where Gerd Wilders has gained popularity.

What does this tell us? What can be a logical explenation for this observations? That's maybe a perfect test for deductive reasoning. And since the March for Science was also done more for the party of friends then to convert dissbelievers it's a good start. What is the general law that we can find by looking at all these instances? I think that the truth is that we are our own clients. We have no other clients then ourselves. We do all these things to keep us busy to keep us busy. There is no need for a virtual open day as much as there is no need for another UM website. So why do we insist to do so? Is it because we are not creative enough to come up with something so novel and so suitable for the purpose? Is it because we lack a training in perception and the arts? Is it because we really work for ourselves first and for the company second? Wait. The last one does contradict the premise. 

But lets come back to the feeling of dissapointment. My dissapointment is the result of simple missunderstanding. I feel not taking seriously when I produce almost a guide book like structure that I guess for a collegue who deals with the subject matter intimedly. This feeling is not justified of course - it is my dissability to communicate proper - but I still feel that I need to make a point. Maybe it is a good idea to add a sentence in the document = this document is worhtless and a joke. Tell bernd that he is dulls at your next meeting with him. = and ask if they found it. 

I guess everybody looked at the budget. Do you have any comments on it? Do you think some posts are to high others too low?

Is the budget now approved or not? And what does approval mean here?

Is it true that the only way to get recognision here is have enough zeros in the budget?

How correct is the budget? Can I test it? On some specific part?!


First proposal: 45.000 Euro (Julienne requested and presented in March)
Second proposal: 60.000 Euro (Presented on 13. April because it was too low)
Third proposal: 170.000 Euro (Latest proposal discussed with Meredith)



26th of April: There is no consensus on the budget. There is apparently no consensus upon what we communicate neither in what style we choose to do so. 

- Meeting with Dimitri and Tijttes Alexander as well as tim to learn about the Student portal. Interesting meeting

25th of April: I have a meeting with Nicole where we are not sure what content - in detail - is to be produced and what its relevance is for this project.  

- Meeting with Oudenijeweme Peter and Manon Habets Lisanne and Rick about the BMOD app. This meeting was a failure on every step. We had the wrong questions for the wrong people. Rick was well prepared.

24th of April: P2P learning event where Michiel speaks about the project management of the Web project, its cycles etc.

21th of April: Discussion with Meredith about latest budget and content strategy

19th of April: I meet with Meredith and four students of the UCM where I presented the concept, asked questions, did a brief brainstorm free style session and made of all notes.

19th of April: I did the same with Ellen Krijnen in person. I showed her the mockup, explained to her the rough idea and noted down her experiences.

18th of April: I meet with students from the country team (three in total) whom I explained this time the project problem, showcased the solution and asked their feedback. I noted everything down and even made audio recordings of the talks.

13th of April: I meet with Denis, Meredith and Manon and I showcased the mockup, discussed the budget and we decided that a. the concept needs fine tuneing and b. the budget needs to be doubled

13th of April: Another meeting with Zoe and Anneloes to discuss matters again. Result was a email send by Anneloes with themes and suggestions. 

12th of April: I meet with Loek from Science Vision to talk about his opinion about the budget and possible setups for the video content.

11th of April: We had another brainstorm meeting with Pascal, Zoe, Anneloes and Britta.

- Meeting with Annabel after I asked if I can make have the footage from the Campus Tour. First she tried to explain to me the difference between a licensing rights and authors rights, when I insisted that I want to see the contract then she negated the point she tried to bring across that I need the authors approval to use the footage. Then she asked what I want to do with it and I apologised that I do not mention it in the email.


6th of April: We had a brainstorm after the Editors meeting with Dunja, Femke, Jean-Pierre, Britta, Nicole and Annabel. 

6th of April: I gave a presentation of in the Editor's meeting and they came up with the idea to sit together and brain storm about possible solutions to the initial problem outlined in my presentation.

==== May 2017 ====

1. May: Meeting with Caroline
Ich dachte immer das eine Präsentation das Ziel hat dem Publikum information zu bringen anstatt dem Leiter eine Platform zu bieten seine (in diesem Fall ihre) Gedanken besser zu ordnen. 

2. May: Meeting with Brams
Machinegun mouth and very pleasant ideas. Needs access to equipment without expenses, advice on ICT and media services as well as a network. Is very hyped about the edu tech scene. Wife also works in this area - last job campaign manager for HC.

Not much news, all in Notebook

4. May: Meeting for Virtual Day Project with Zoe
Good meeting. Offered to have students write experience reports about the themes I propose and answer me the questions.
Further more working on details and presentations

8. May:

The feedback was good but not conclusive. The first question revolved around how the magic happens. How does the system select the programme and calculate the "match". There is great potential for confusion. Overall there was little feedback and I tried to give everybody the feeling that its not set in stone but their idea. They can mold it add to it and give it more flesh. The question was how this relates to the MSc or if it is included.

9 May

- Contact Mariette and send her:
-- link to project proposal
-- questionaire 
-- Call for better ideas
-- Requests: the golden lectureres, floor maps, photograph

>> DONE

- Send email to Kirsten Engbersen

Todo: Contacting SSC, BIB, FHML
Ask for interns/student assistent or put a call into the newsletter
-- Contact Tanja Peters: She has list of promoteamers of which some might be DKE students

-- Idea: Ask students (promoteamers or Zoes crowd) to compile all material for a BSc programme.
-- Realize the project in Phases

 
10 May
- Meeting with Wilco, Manon and Peter together with Rick, brought very nice pastries, meeting was successful and not very active
- Nothing is happening except some emails and meeting from 1 - 3 with Manon and Rick. The Hornist nest is definatley up for sale. She gets very emotional (for her standards) when confronted with the idea to give all the course information available for free. 
- Now I visit a house and work longer because at 17:30 somebody is calling me from Qaltrix

Maybe I should build on the local machine a WP setup with a basic version that could go live by June. Also a crowd sourcing campaign that allows to get a better grip on the actual content. This can serve as a basis. Additionally Zoes students need a task list. And I should send the first questionair with a very positiv email to all parties involved in the doomsday meeting asking them to provide more then just an idea.


11. May
- Contacted the student project team again and ensure that we can meet up and run the show.


You have approved an SSL/TLS certificate for the domain name www.umdinoapp.me

12. May
- Meeting with Student Project Team. This was very interesting and also helpful
- Jeroen came to congratulate me to my parenthood adventure; I should contact Linda - a student assistent - that does research in what students want to know.
- Worked on SSL certificate and mapping the domain. Need to print out invoices and ensure that I get the declaration form in.
- 

13. May
- More organisational parts

15. May
Some remarks about the email conversation with Nicole. Nicole believes that everything needs to be discussed at faculty level. Any integrated approach to the matter is utterly depreciated. 

What are the facts. Nicole assumed, like Meredith, that the two meetings have the same purpose. The first was organised by myself after the meeting on 12. April with Meredith, Manon and Denis to which Nicole was also invited. The second one was initiated by Nicole after our first meeting where I presented the project plan and everything else. With the unsatisfactory result that she asked Patricia to schedule a meeting. This happens four weeks later. What do you do in four weeks time? I mean - with the internet and all of it. I wrote everything down and structued it as best as I can. Then I shared it with everybody to give me comments or feedback. After no comments nor feedback came back I formulated precise questions and distributed it again.

16. May
- Huging Nicole - its all not so bad. Bimmel, Arsch, Bussy T-Shirt link bekommen. Vielleicht eine Art Mitleid entgegenzuwirken
- Meeting mit N, A, P. Alle anderen abgesagt. Cheat Sheet gemacht fuer alle und ein email recap nachgesendet. 
- Das Problem war das niemand Gluecklich war mit meinen Punkten:
  - Explainer Video: Punkt war das ich mit den Fakultaeten sprechen soll und die a. den text schreiben und b. den presentator stellen. Mein standpunkt ist das a. nicole oder einer der editoren auf basis ther verfuegbaren information einen 3000 worte umfassenden text verfassen der das script ist b. das wir entweder schauspieler nehmen die in einem Studio den text vortragen und die Produktionsfirma das ausfertigt.
  - Nicoles punkt ist das wir das selbe problem haben wie mit Nicole. 
  - Ich sende ein email mit folgenden Recap noten: 

- Annabel starts working on the production and coordination of the explainer videos
- Annabel finds 18 lecturers/programme experts that will present and also write the script according to the general outlines presented
- Annabel requests a quote from external suppliers for the production of 18 explainer videos -> once we agree with the supplier she will plan together with the production company the videos. 
- Am selben tag werde ich zu einem Meeting eingeladen - Joris Submedia VOD short brainstorm - Hi Joris, Bernd, Michel heeft helaas geen tijd om erbij te zijn.

Groet
Annabel
- Michel's anmerking war das Annabel nicht sehr interessiert daran war und sagte "Bernd's Projekt". Er gab sich distanziert vorllem dadurch das er Annabel kennt. Er gab mir auch den tip einfach ein Team in the Fakultaeten zusammen zustellen um diese Dinge zu Besprechen. Ein wirklich guter tip!


- Nun steht sie in meinem Buero: 11:00

Im Grunde geht es jetzt darum ob meine idee oder ihre durchgeht.

1. Ob sie Zugang kriegen kann zu den lectures war ihre erste Frage.
2. Die Zweite Frage oder besser Erklärung war ob wir eine Liste mit programm direktoren haben. 
3. Ob ich weis ob sie Zeit haben oder die Programm direktoren mitarbeiten wollen.

An disem Punkt habe ich mir gedacht. Wie hab ich diese Fragen beantwortet? Erfahrung oder Recherge. Wie geht man daran. Man kann sie alle einfach fragen selbstverstaendlich und hoffen das jemand sagt ja ich sag mir wann ich wo sein soll und was ich vorbereiten soll und dann mach ich das gerne!

Es scheint schwierig zu sein 

- Nun hatten wir ein Meeting : 12:30

Mit Josh. Sublime Media oder so. 
- Zuerst hat sie gesagt das die orignale idea die war die sie selbst bedacht hat. Und zwar so wie meine Erfahrung mir gelernt hat das es nichts bringt.
- Was kann man ihr fuer einen Rat geben? Time Management Kurs, Time Management Kurs, Entspannungs uebungen, ganz viel Urlaub, 
- Seine anmerkungen: Jung ja und eher native speakers
- Ihr Argument: Fuer Niederlaender sprechen die Native speaker zu schnell
- Seine anmerkungen: entweder variante A oder B. Nicht gemischt aufnehmen. (Also Akteure und echte Professoren/Lecturer/Programme directors)
